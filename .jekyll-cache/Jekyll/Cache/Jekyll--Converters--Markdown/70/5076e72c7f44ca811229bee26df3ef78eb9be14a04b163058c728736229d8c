I"i<p>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.</p>

<p>Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.</p>

<p>I will face my fear.</p>

<p>I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</p>

<p>And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.</p>

<p>Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.</p>

<p>Only I will remain.</p>
